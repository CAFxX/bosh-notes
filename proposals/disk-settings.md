# Summary

As an operator, I expect to be able to specify ephemeral/persistent disk settings such as number of inodes.

# Motivation

Use cases:

- "prometheus bosh release create a lot of small files and the /var/vcap/store runs out of inodes" (https://cloudfoundry.slack.com/archives/C02HPPYQ2/p1525120421000449)
