# Details

Users typically integrate with an IaaS, and hence provision following resources:

- networks: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-notes/blob/master/proposals/network-mgmt.md
- load balancers: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-notes/blob/master/proposals/load-balancer-mgmt.md
- vips: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-notes/blob/master/proposals/vip-network-auto-assignment.md
- security groups: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-notes/blob/master/proposals/security-group-mgmt.md
